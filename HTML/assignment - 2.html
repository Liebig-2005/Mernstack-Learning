      Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves,
      characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of
      hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a
      strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size
      from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common
      ostrich. There are over 11,000 living species and they are split into 44
      orders. More than half are passerine or "perching" birds. Birds have wings
      whose development varies according to species; the only known groups
      without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are
      modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further
      evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites,
      penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and
      respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some
      bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some
      waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming. The study of birds is
      called ornithology.

      <strong> Birds </strong>are feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from
      earlier theropods, and constitute the only known living dinosaurs.
